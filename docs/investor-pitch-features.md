# Karma Compass: MVP & Feature Tiers for Investor Pitch

This document outlines the strategic product roadmap for Karma Compass, defining the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and a tiered feature rollout designed for sustainable growth and monetization.

---

## 1. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

**Goal:** Validate the core loop: *Students will engage in positive behaviors for gamified rewards and motivation.*

The MVP is intentionally lean to quickly test our primary hypothesis with minimal development cost.

### Student-Facing MVP Features:
- **Simple Daily Journal:** A single text area for daily reflection.
- **Core Karma Tracker:** A limited, curated list of the most impactful positive and negative activities.
- **Daily Karma Score:** The basic calculation and display of the day's score.
- **AI Motivational Quote:** A simple, score-based motivational message to close the feedback loop.
- **Basic Wallet:** Students can *earn* in-app virtual currency (Karma Coins), but it cannot be topped up or redeemed yet. This creates the desire to upgrade.

### Parent-Facing MVP Features:
- **Account Linking:** Ability for a parent to securely link to one child's account.
- **Simple Dashboard:** View only the child's daily Karma Score. No deep analytics.
